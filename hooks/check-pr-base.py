"""
Validates `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` Bash invocations against the
Git Flow base-branch matrix:

    feature/*  ->  develop
    hotfix/*   ->  main
    release/*  ->  main

Reads PreToolUse JSON from stdin. Emits a deny payload to stdout when the
command would create or merge a PR with the wrong base; exits 0 otherwise.

Always exits 0 (success) — even on internal exceptions, fails open.
