# Git Flow Finish Branch

Complete current Git Flow branch: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Current Repository State

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Branch type: !`git branch --show-current | grep -oE '^(feature|release|hotfix)' || echo "Not a Git Flow branch"`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Unpushed commits: !`git log @{u}.. --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- Latest tag: !`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "No tags"`

## Task

Complete the current Git Flow branch by merging it to appropriate target branch(es).

### 1. Branch Type Detection

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

if [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == feature/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="feature"
  MERGE_TO="develop"
  CREATE_TAG="no"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == release/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="release"
  MERGE_TO="main develop"
  CREATE_TAG="yes"
  TAG_NAME="${CURRENT_BRANCH#release/}"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == hotfix/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="hotfix"
  MERGE_TO="main develop"
  CREATE_TAG="yes"
  TAG_NAME="${CURRENT_BRANCH#hotfix/}"
else
  echo "Not on a Git Flow branch (feature/release/hotfix)"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 2. Pre-Merge Validation

- All changes committed (clean working directory)
- All commits pushed to remote
- No merge conflicts with target branch(es)

### 3. Feature Branch Finish

#### Via PR (preferred — always squash merge)

```bash
# Find the open PR for this branch
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --json number --jq '.[0].number')

# Squash merge — combines all commits into a single commit on develop
gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash --delete-branch
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
```

#### Local fallback (when no PR exists)

```bash
git push
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff feature/$NAME -m "Merge feature/$NAME into develop

$(git log develop..feature/$NAME --oneline)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push origin develop

# Use -D (force) because squash merge creates different SHA
git branch -D feature/$NAME 2>/dev/null || true
git push origin --delete feature/$NAME 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 4. Release Branch Finish

```bash
VERSION="${CURRENT_BRANCH#release/}"
git push

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/$VERSION -m "Merge release/$VERSION into main

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Tag (unless --no-tag)
git tag -a $VERSION -m "Release $VERSION"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff release/$VERSION -m "Merge release/$VERSION back into develop

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push origin develop

# Cleanup (unless --no-delete)
git branch -d release/$VERSION
git push origin --delete release/$VERSION
```

### 4a. Create GitHub Release (release and hotfix only)

After tagging and pushing, **always create a GitHub release** with user-friendly notes.

1. **Check previous release format** to match conventions:
   ```bash
   gh release view $(git tag --sort=-v:refname | sed -n '2p') --json body --jq '.body' | head -20
   ```

2. **Generate user-friendly release notes** from the CHANGELOG. Read the `[VERSION]` section
   from CHANGELOG.md, then rewrite each entry to be product/user-facing:
   - Remove internal implementation details (file paths, function names, config keys)
   - Describe what changed from the user's perspective, not what code was modified
   - Keep the same section headers (### Fixed, ### Added, ### Changed, etc.)

3. **Create the release** matching the format of previous releases:
   ```bash
   gh release create $VERSION --title "$VERSION" --notes "<user-friendly notes>"
   ```

### 4b. Post-release develop version bump (release and hotfix only)

After merging back to develop, bump the version to the next patch and ensure `[Unreleased]` is ready for new entries:

1. **Bump version** — run `./scripts/bump-version.sh patch` if the script exists, otherwise manually increment the patch version in the project's version file (package.json, plugin.json, etc.)

2. **Ensure `[Unreleased]` header exists** — check if CHANGELOG.md has an empty `## [Unreleased]` section at the top (above the just-released version). If not, add one:
   ```markdown
   ## [Unreleased]

   ## [x.y.z] - date
   ...
   ```

3. **Commit** on develop:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore(develop): bump version for next development cycle

   Previous release: $VERSION

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   git push origin develop
   ```

### 5. Hotfix Branch Finish

Same as release finish but uses hotfix branch name. The tag is the hotfix version (already set on the branch). **Also creates a GitHub release** (step 4a) and **bumps develop version** (step 4b).

### 6. Error Handling

**Not on Git Flow Branch:** Guide user to correct branch.
**Uncommitted Changes:** Ask to commit/stash.
**Unpushed Commits:** Offer to push.
**Merge Conflicts:** Show conflicting files and resolution steps.

### 7. Arguments

- `--no-delete` — Keep branch after merging
- `--no-tag` — Skip tag creation (release/hotfix only)
