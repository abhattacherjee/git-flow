# Git Flow Release Branch

Create new release branch: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Current Repository State

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Latest tag: !`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "No tags found"`
- Commits since last tag: !`git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null)..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- Package.json version: !`cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep '"version"' | head -1 || echo "No package.json found"`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Task

Create a Git Flow release branch following these steps:

### 1. Version Validation

Validate the version format and ensure it's newer than current:

- Must follow semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Examples: `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`, `v0.5.0-beta.1`

**Version Increment Logic** (analyze commits since last tag):
- **MAJOR** (v2.0.0): Breaking changes (`BREAKING CHANGE:` in commits)
- **MINOR** (v1.3.0): New features (`feat:` commits)
- **PATCH** (v1.2.1): Bug fixes only (`fix:` commits)

See the `git-flow` skill for the full semver selection guide.

### 2. Create Release Branch

```bash
# Switch to develop and update
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/$ARGUMENTS

# Update package.json version (if Node.js project)
npm version ${ARGUMENTS#v} --no-git-tag-version

# Commit version bump
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to ${ARGUMENTS#v}

# Push to remote with tracking
git push -u origin release/$ARGUMENTS
```

### 3. CHANGELOG Generation

**If CHANGELOG.md has entries under `## [Unreleased]`:**

Move those entries into a new versioned section. Replace:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- existing entry from feature branches
...
```

With:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [$ARGUMENTS] - [Current Date]

### Added
- existing entry from feature branches
...
```

The `[Unreleased]` header stays but is now empty. The existing entries move under the new versioned header. Review the entries and supplement with any additional changes from commits since the last tag that aren't already listed.

**If CHANGELOG.md has no entries under `## [Unreleased]`:**

Generate changelog from commits since last tag, grouped by type:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [$ARGUMENTS] - [Current Date]

### Added
- [feat: commits]

### Fixed
- [fix: commits]

### Changed
- [refactor:/perf:/chore: commits]

### Documentation
- [docs: commits]
```

### 4. Success Response

```
Release Branch Ready: $ARGUMENTS

Branch: release/$ARGUMENTS
Base: develop
Target: main (after review)

Next Steps:
1. Review CHANGELOG.md for accuracy
2. Run final tests
3. Create PR to main: gh pr create --base main
4. Get team approvals
5. Run /finish to complete release (or /finalize-release if available)

Release Tips:
- No new features on release branch — bug fixes only
- Keep release branch short-lived
- Tag will be created when merged to main
```

### 5. Error Handling

**No Version Provided:**
```
Version is required

Usage: /release <version>

Examples:
  /release v1.2.0
  /release v2.0.0-beta.1

Current version: [from git describe]
Suggested version: [based on commit analysis]
```

**Invalid Version Format:**
```
Invalid version format: "$ARGUMENTS"

Correct format: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (must start with 'v')
```

**Uncommitted Changes:**
```
Uncommitted changes detected. Commit or stash first.
```
